             0x0A. C - argc, argv

At the end of this project, I am able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

1. How to use arguments passed to your program
2. What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
3. How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
